1.0 :	Initial upload to SourceForge

1.1 :	Added ability to modify what types of characters are included in passwords.
		-	Some websites and applications do not allow for specific symbols in passwords. For this reason, users may
			now choose to limit the types of symbols that can be used, or to not use symbols at all. It is recommended
			to use as many symbols as the service in question will allow.
			
	Now warns the user if the generated password is shorter than 12 characters as that may not be very secure.

	Update of seed conversion and password generation methods
		-	Previously, seeds were simply converted directly into long integer values. This could lead to collisions
			(i.e. different seeds had the same value). Now seed characters also have their value multiplied by 
			their position in the seed. This means that even anagrams are unlikely to have the same value.
			Collisions are still possible, but their likelyhood has been greatly reduced.
		-	Password generation initially used one board of character values. This board was based on the initial seed
			and remained unchanged throughout generation. Now the value of each selected move is added to the initial seed
			after each character is added. This means that passwords will not have as many commonalities
			if the same seed is used or if there is a collision with two seeds. Basically, move 1 now helps to determine
			the value of move 2, which helps to determine the value of move 3, and so on.
			
	Additionally, there were source code and performance improvements. And the source code was also uploaded to GitHub.
